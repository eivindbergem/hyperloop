## FAQ

### Why async? Can't we just use plain old stackful tasks?

Async tasks have a minimal memory footprint and are a good fit for
memory constrained microcontrollers. Tasks should be cheap and you
should be able to another task without having to worry much about
memory usage. Stackful tasks need a lot of memory for the stack,
especially if you need string formatting for logging. Stackful tasks
do allow for preemption, but it comes at a high price.

### How does Hyperloop differ from [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy)

Embassy provides not only an executor, but a whole embedded async
ecosystem. Hyperloop is much more limited in scope. The main
difference between the Embassy exeutor and Hyperloop is that Hyperloop
uses priority based scheduling.
